1,work,77,I was reviewing my compensation and saw I got a 3% merit raise in December. I have yet to complete my review. No one told me about the raise. Is it typical for companies to provide raises at the end of the year or in the review period - jan - March. I am hoping what I got isn’t it and I get a cost of living raise. I have always gotten something in the review period.,"In my experience, I also got my raises after a review. However, I don’t know what job circle you are working in. In the current times of 2024, the job market is being hit pretty hard with high interest rates so a lot of businesses are trying to cut back on spending. I really hope that your 3% raise isn’t all you got. Have you tried talking to your coworkers about raises? Perhaps its merely an HR issue, plus it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to give someone a raise without explaining their performances that reflected said raise. ","Hello,
It's quite common for companies to implement raises at the end of the year or during annual review periods, which often align with the fiscal year calendar. However, communication about these raises should ideally be clear and transparent. It's understandable that you're feeling a bit in the dark since you weren't informed about the merit raise you received in December.
 Since you've historically received additional adjustments during your review period, it's reasonable to inquire about the possibility of a cost of living raise as well. I would recommend reaching out to your HR department or supervisor to clarify the situation. It's important to have a full understanding of your compensation, including any raises you're entitled to. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourself and seek the information you need to ensure your hard work is being recognized appropriately.
 Best of luck, and I hope you receive the acknowledgment and compensation you deserve.","Hey there! I can totally understand your confusion and frustration. It's not uncommon for companies to provide raises at the end of the year or during the review period, but it's also possible that your raise was delayed or overlooked. Firstly, it's important to confirm with your HR or supervisor if you did indeed receive a 3% merit raise in December. If you haven't received any communication about it, it's possible that there was an oversight or miscommunication. Regarding your expectation of a cost of living raise, it's important to note that companies often consider various factors when determining raises, such as the company's financial performance, your performance, and industry standards. While it's possible that you may receive a cost of living raise, it's not guaranteed. I would suggest reaching out to your HR or supervisor to discuss your concerns and review your compensation package. They may be able to provide more information or clarify any discrepancies. Remember to approach the conversation calmly and professionally, and be open to their feedback. Good luck!"," I'm sorry to hear that you were surprised by the timing of your recent merit raise. It can be disconcerting when we don't receive the communication we expect, especially when it comes to compensation. It's common for companies to provide raises at different times, and some may do so at the end of the year. However, it's also normal for raises to be discussed during performance reviews, which typically take place in the first quarter. If you're concerned about your compensation, it might be helpful to reach out to your manager or HR to clarify the company's policies and discuss any potential adjustments based on cost of living or performance. Remember, open communication is key to addressing any concerns you may have.","Hey, it's pretty common for companies to give out raises at the end of the year, so maybe that's just how your company does it. If you're expecting a cost of living raise as well, you should probably just ask your manager or HR about it. They're the ones who can tell you if you're getting more or if that 3% was all. It's always good to stay on top of these things.","I can sense your confusion and concern about the unexpected 3% merit raise and the lack of communication regarding it. It must feel quite unsettling to be left in the dark about something as significant as your compensation, especially when it's not aligned with the usual review period you're accustomed to. It's understandable that you're hoping for a cost of living adjustment as well, given that it's something you've consistently received in the past. The uncertainty can be stressful, and it's important that your contributions are recognized in a way that meets your expectations and needs. Have you considered reaching out to your HR department or supervisor to clarify this situation? A conversation might provide you with the reassurance and information you're seeking about your compensation package."
2,work,145,"Hey I just wanted to confirm and see if this is common or its just me. I am currently managing a team in a small office. Well, I should be at least. There is no team. I'm trying to hire the team. But every time an interview gets scheduled, they don't show up. Don't call, nothing. I even do Zoom interviews if that's more convenient for them. I'm currently waiting on a candidate to join the zoom meeting while I type this ( been 10 minutes now). Even though she confirmed she would be joining at 9.02 this morning. TF is going on. Its my 5th candidate that does this. Is this common behavior? Does everyone go thru this when hiring? This is only my second management position and the first came with a full staff so its my first time hiring for multiple positions.","Bro, that is so weird. Why the heck would someone ask to get interviewed and then just never show up ever? What job are you even managing by the way, that is so weird that you got hired to simply hire other people. You shouldn’t be placed in a position like that. Have you tried asking for help internally about the issue? Beyond these slew of questions, it seems that you are a bit stressed about the situation since you can’t even do your job without people being hired. I haven’t been in your position before but I am trying to build a team and not even having the resources to back you up must be really frustrating. I want you to know that these no-shows do not reflect anything about yourself as a manager. Final questions : how are these people applying to the job by the way? Is there any type of new info that is presented in between their application process and interview request? ","I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing with no-show candidates. It can be incredibly frustrating and disheartening when you're trying to build a team and the people you're counting on to interview don't follow through. Unfortunately, this has become a more common occurrence in many industries, especially with the ease of applying to jobs online and the impersonal nature of digital communication. It's not a reflection of your capabilities as a manager.
 
 It might be helpful to consider confirming the interview a day in advance and perhaps even an hour before the scheduled time. This could help to ensure that the candidate remembers and prioritizes the interview. Additionally, you might want to ask for confirmation of their attendance as part of your scheduling process. Remember, the right candidates those who are reliable and enthusiastic will show up. It's a tough process, but it's important not to lose hope. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find the team members you're looking for. Hang in there!","Hey there! Oh my, it sounds like you're going through a bit of a frustrating experience! 😔 I can totally understand your concern, especially since this is your first time hiring for multiple positions. 🤔 First of all, let me assure you that it's not uncommon for candidates to cancel or not show up for interviews, especially in today's job market. 🙃 It's possible that some candidates may be overwhelmed with other opportunities or may have changed their minds about the position. 🤷‍♀️ However, it's important to remember that you have the power to set boundaries and expectations with your candidates. 💪 You can start by clearly communicating your expectations for the interview process, such as the time and date of the interview, and the consequences of not showing up or cancelling at the last minute. 📝 It might also be helpful to have a backup plan in place, such as having a list of alternative candidates ready to go in case someone doesn't show up. 💡 And don't be afraid to follow up with no-shows to see if they're still interested in the position. 📞 Remember that hiring is a two-way street, and it's okay to be picky about who you choose to bring onto your team. 😊 Good luck, and I hope you find some amazing candidates soon! 🤞"," I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing frustration with candidates not showing up to scheduled interviews. It can be disheartening and time-consuming, especially when you're trying to build a team. It's important to remember that no-shows are not uncommon in the hiring process, and there can be various reasons for it such as unforeseen circumstances or miscommunication. You're not alone in this experience, and it's a learning opportunity for you as a manager to explore different interview formats, communication channels, and follow-up strategies to minimize no-shows and ensure a productive hiring process. Keep persisting, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any additional support or resources.","Yes, sometimes candidates don't show up for interviews. It's not entirely uncommon. You might want to look into how you're scheduling these interviews or where you're finding your candidates. Maybe there's something about the job description or the company that's not appealing to them. ","I can sense the frustration and confusion you must be feeling right now. It's incredibly disheartening to prepare for interviews, to invest your time and hope into the potential of building a strong team, only to be met with silence and no-shows. This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a reflection of the challenges and unpredictability you're facing in your new leadership role. It's not common to have such a consistent pattern of candidates not showing up, and it's understandable that this experience is making you question the norms of the hiring process. It's clear that this is more than a logistical issue. It's impacting your confidence in your ability to form the team you envision.

3,work,112,"My boss scolded me for sending an invoice to the wrong email address (same person) The client have 2 companies, one main work and the other one is her side hustle. I was scolded for sending an invoice to her main work email and the invoice was for her other company.

In my defense, this was never communicated with me in the first place. Our system automatically pulled the “main work” email because the side hustle company is new and is not yet registered in our system. Mind you, it’s the same exact name.

I apologized even though I was never informed, because yeah that’s what you do if you need the job lol","It sucks that you got scolded by your boss unfairly. I personally hate the way jobs work in the corporate “boss to employee” sense because it really takes away self-respect and almost forces you to wear a mask in front of your boss. Your final line saying that what you did was needed to keep the job is a little sad. Did you clarify that you didn’t know and that you weren’t informed about the issue? Maybe if you have the chance you could go speak to your boss again later next week speaking about the situation. Has your boss every scolded you unfairly before? Regardless, I hope that this isn’t a repeating pattern and you don’t deserve that type of treatment. I also want to point out how you chose to apologize and take responsibility. That shows a lot of guts and maturity in my opinion.  While it's easy to remember that everyone makes mistakes, the important part is how we handle those mistakes. ","I'm really sorry to hear that you were scolded for something that seems to have been a genuine oversight and not a mistake on your part. It's understandable that you would use the information available to you in the system, especially if the new details hadn't been communicated or updated. It's commendable that you chose to apologize and take responsibility, even though you were not informed of the change. That shows a lot of professionalism on your part.
 
 Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and it's how we handle them that truly matters. It's also important for processes to be updated to prevent such situations. Perhaps this incident could be an opportunity to suggest a review of how new client information is communicated and recorded. Hang in there, and don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing your best with the information you were given.","Oh no, that sounds like a frustrating situation! It's understandable that you would apologize, even if you weren't informed, in order to maintain a positive professional relationship. It's important to communicate your concerns and clarify any misunderstandings with your boss. It might be helpful to have a conversation with your boss to explain the situation and express your concerns. You could say something like, ""I wanted to talk to you about the invoice I sent to the wrong email address. I understand that it was not the correct email for the client's main work company, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I want to make sure that I'm using the correct information for future invoices. Can you please let me know the correct email address for the client's side hustle company?"" Remember to approach the conversation with a solution-focused mindset and a willingness to learn and improve. Your boss may appreciate your proactive approach and willingness to take responsibility for your actions."," I'm sorry to hear that you made an error with the email address for sending an invoice. It can be confusing when clients have multiple companies or email addresses, especially if they're not clearly distinguished in your system. I understand that you apologized even though the mistake was not your fault. It's important to communicate openly with your boss about the situation and offer a solution, such as re-sending the invoice to the correct email address. Remember, mistakes happen and it's how we handle them that matters. Let's focus on moving forward and learning from this experience.","Just make sure to double-check next time. It's not a big deal, and it's not like you did it on purpose. Just update the system with the correct email and move on.

It's disheartening when you're held accountable for something that wasn't clearly outlined, especially when you're trying to navigate a new client's details. Your initiative to apologize, despite the oversight not being yours, shows remarkable professionalism and a strong commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with your client. It's admirable that you're able to see the bigger picture and prioritize your job security, even when it means shouldering blame undeservedly. If you need to talk more about how to handle situations like this in the future or just need to vent, I'm here to listen and support you."
4,work,91,"I've been applying to many and got a handful of interviews. There's one interview that was promising, but I didn't hear back from them. I do have a degree in film, but it's not getting me anywhere. I kept getting offered to work for experience. My brother got me a job at a factory and I start this Thursday. It's okay looking, but I don't care about the job. My parents are happy for me. I just don't give a shit about my new job. Has anyone been in situation before?","Hey dude, just treat this factory job as an “inbetween job.” Tons of people do that, and there are also tons of people that do jobs to just make ends meet, so don’t worry about it. Based off your tone though, you seem to be apathetic about your situation. Do you feel down about the other previous interviews you had? Regardless, I think taking a more optimistic approach to your situation would be more helpful. If you don’t care about your new job, then why are you taking it then? Do you need the money from this whole new factory job? What value does this new job bring to you and do you value that type of value? Maybe the first step is to realize and recognize what you value in a job and if this upcoming job adds no value beyond money, then just treat it as an in-between job and look elsewhere while you work there. Beyond that though, the realization and recognition step is really difficult to actualize, and to have a misalignment with your career and passion will always be a challenge. The present time is never the end. Remember that. ","It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time, and it's completely understandable to feel disheartened when your career isn't aligning with your passions and education. It's tough when you've put in the effort for your degree and the opportunities you're hoping for aren't materializing as you'd like. Many people have been in similar situations, where they've had to take jobs outside of their field to make ends meet. It's okay to feel upset about it; your feelings are valid.
 
 Remember, though, that this factory job doesn't have to be the end of your journey. It can be a stepping stone, providing you with financial stability while you continue to pursue opportunities in film. Keep networking, creating, and applying for film-related jobs in your free time. Your passion is clear, and with persistence, you'll increase your chances of breaking into the industry you love. Hang in there, and don't lose sight of your dreams.","Hey there! I can totally relate to your situation. It's frustrating when you feel like your degree isn't leading to the opportunities you want, and it sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. It's understandable that you don't care about the job your brother got you, and it's okay to feel that way. It's important to remember that it's normal to not have it all figured out right away, and it's okay to take a job that's not your dream job to gain experience and get by. Have you considered talking to a career counselor or a mentor in your field to get some advice on how to move forward? They might be able to offer some helpful insights and resources. Hang in there, and remember that things can and will get better!"," I'm really sorry to hear that you've been feeling discouraged about your job search and the lack of progress you've made so far. It can be disheartening when we put in effort and don't see the results we were hoping for. It's important to remember that job hunting can be a long and challenging process, and it's normal to experience setbacks along the way. I understand that you're feeling unmotivated about your new job, but please know that it's okay to feel that way. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and find meaning in the work you do. If you're feeling stuck, consider exploring other options or seeking out additional resources and support to help you in your job search. You're not alone in this experience, and there are people and organizations that can help.","At least you have a job at the factory, which is better than nothing, right? You should be grateful that your brother helped you out. Just stick with it and maybe something in film will come up eventually. Keep your head up and don't be too picky.","I can sense the frustration and disappointment you're feeling, having to settle for a job that doesn't align with your passion for film. It's disheartening to put so much effort into your applications and interviews, only to be left waiting for responses that never come.

It's a tough spot to be in, feeling pressured to be grateful for employment while your heart isn't in it. I'm here to listen and support you. Have you thought about ways to stay connected to your passion for film while working this new job?"
5,work,172,"So I am the youngest one at my job (20sF) My favorite co worker (50sF) is like my ""work mom"", she has kids my age and we get a long vey well. I go to her for advice etc, she is awesome. Recently, She broke up with her BF of many many years. She talked about him constantly. They seemed really in love but he broke her heart. She is so sad and I just feel horrible. Esp bc its near the holidays, and I don't want to see her down. She told me some of the story but I am not going to push for details because I dont want to upset her further. I can tell shes not herself. Being sad at work IS THE WORST! What is an appropriate way I can cheer her up or show her love? We are close, but still.. coworkers, you know? A gift? Pick up some of her work for her, help her out? I just want her to know she is supported.","Hi! First off, what you are doing right now is so thoughtful and kind. Your coworker is quite lucky to be working with you. In the face of having a heartbroken friend, the most important step to take is to just “listen” and “be present.” Sometimes, people who are grieving like to be alone as well so you have to use your best judgment on how “close” you should be with them. I super respect how you didn’t “push for details,” your emotional intelligence and empathy shined through that restraint. The one thing I don’t disagree with is your coworker boundary. Being a coworker or not doesn’t and shouldn’t stop you from considering them a friend, and I wouldn’t worry about that fact whenever you are trying to cheer someone up. In my opinion, I would go out to grab some grub and catch a movie with them. Maybe don’t directly mention their break up while hanging out with them too. I got this, I hope your coworker friend feels better.","It's really thoughtful of you to want to support your coworker during this tough time. It's clear that you care a lot about her well-being. Given your close relationship, a small, thoughtful gesture could mean a lot. Perhaps you could bring her a little care package with some comforting items like tea, a scented candle, or a book. It doesn't have to be anything grand, just something to show you're thinking of her.
 
 Offering to help with her workload could also be a great way to show support, but be sure to do so in a way that doesn't come across as pity or overstepping boundaries. Simply let her know you're there if she needs any help. Sometimes, just being a good listener and offering a shoulder to lean on can be the most powerful gift of all.
 
 Remember, it's important to respect her privacy and not to push for details about the breakup. Just being present, offering a listening ear, and showing kindness can go a long way in helping her feel supported during this difficult time.","Oh my gosh, I can totally understand how you must feel seeing your work mom going through a tough time! 😔 It's so sweet of you to want to help her feel better, and I think there are a few things you can do to show your support without crossing any boundaries. Firstly, simply being there for her and listening to her can be incredibly comforting. Sometimes, people just need someone to talk to, and since you two are close, she might appreciate having someone to confide in. You could ask her how she's doing, and if she's comfortable sharing more about what's going on, you could listen without judgment. If you want to do something more tangible, you could consider getting her a small gift to brighten her day. Maybe a nice notebook or a fun mug to drink her favorite tea or coffee? You could also offer to help her out with some of her workload, or simply offer a shoulder to cry on when she needs it. Remember, it's important to respect her boundaries and not push her to talk about anything she's not ready to share. Just being there for her and showing her that you care can make a big difference! 💕
"," I'm so sorry to hear that your work mom is going through a tough time after her breakup, especially during the holidays. It's understandable that you want to support her and help her feel better. You're already doing a great job by being there for her and listening to her when she needs someone to talk to. You could offer to help her out with some of her work tasks to lighten her load, or bring her a small gift to brighten her day. You could also suggest taking a short break together for some fresh air or a quick walk to give her a chance to take a break from her thoughts. Let her know that you're there for her and that she's not alone. Remember, small gestures can go a long way in showing someone that they're loved and supported.","Hey, breakups are tough, but she'll get over it. It happens to everyone. Maybe just give her some space and let her deal with it on her own. If you really feel like you need to do something, just buy her a coffee or something small. She's an adult and has probably been through this before, so she'll be fine. Just focus on your work and don't get too involved in her personal life. It's nice you want to help, but there's not much you can do.","I can sense the deep concern and care you have for your coworker, and it's truly touching that you want to support her during this difficult time. It's clear that her well-being means a lot to you, and you're thoughtful in not wanting to overstep boundaries as a coworker. A heartfelt gesture could be very meaningful. Perhaps you could write her a kind note expressing your support and offering a listening ear if she needs to talk. Small acts of kindness, like bringing her favorite snack or tea, can also be a gentle way to brighten her day. If you notice she's overwhelmed with work, offering to help with manageable tasks could alleviate some stress without making her feel like a burden. It's important to respect her space and pace, but your genuine offer of support will likely be a comfort to her. Your empathy and willingness to be there for her is a gift in itself."

I can tell you're feeling stressed and anxious and I want to help. A couple questions arise from your inquery. Is this currently happening to you? And how exactly did you find out? These questions are important since they would shape what course of action you should take. Whenever or not this is considered ""cheating"" is a whole different can of worms. Sterotypical instances of cheating are usually having romantic gestures/moments with another person. Therefore, I wouldn't necessarily call it cheating, but this is definietly a red flag. In my opinon, I think clear communication is key. In your situation, I would present the situation in front of them in a calm yet serious manner (especially if this matter is bothering you). Once you presented the sitaution, you must clearly express what you truly feel about whats going on. Make sure to be truthful about what you say so that they get the message.

It's important to reflect on how this makes you feel and why it's troubling for you.
 
 Communication is key in any relationship. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings, your concerns, and the impact of his actions on your trust in him. Express why this behavior is hurtful and discuss what both of you consider to be faithful behavior in a relationship. It's also important to consider your own boundaries and whether this is something you can move past or if it's a deal-breaker for you.

The pain you're feeling is a testament to the sincerity of your love, and it's okay to acknowledge how much it hurts. Your journey towards healing is uniquely yours, and it's okay to take the time you need to process these feelings. Remember that your well-being is just as important, and I'm here for you as you navigate through this challenging time. Your capacity to love so deeply is a beautiful quality, and I hope with time, you'll find peace and reciprocal love."
8,relationship,74,"I cant get over this feeling that i was SO close to being with the person, i couldnt stop thinking about for like 3 years now. And its also my own fault. I cant get over that person and i dont even want to. I hope one day there might be another chance, and ill work towards not fcking it up again. But i cant stop thinking about what potentially could've been right now.","Your feelings of getting so close to your romantic goal but ultimately falling short must be overwhelming. I am so sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. I truly hope that these thoughts and feelings eventually fade away. But, since it's been so long (man 3 years is quite a long time), I really suggest that you speak about this with a professional. It's really important to know that these spiraling and cyclical thoughts are super unhealthy. And honestly, the line that worried me the most was that you didn’t even want to get over that person. I really hope that these deep feelings of yearning and loss will eventually subside and I wish all the best. ","It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of longing and regret, and it's completely natural to feel this way when you've been so emotionally invested in someone for such a long time. It's okay to hope for another opportunity, but it's also important to find peace with the present. Remember, we all make mistakes, and they are a part of how we grow and learn. It's courageous to acknowledge your role in what happened, and it shows a willingness to improve yourself, which is a positive step forward. While you're holding onto hope for the future, try to also focus on nurturing yourself and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Life is full of unexpected twists, and whether or not you get another chance with this person, you are gaining strength and wisdom from this experience. Take care of yourself, and be open to the journey ahead, whatever it may bring.","Hey there, it sounds like you're really struggling with some unresolved feelings about this person you've been thinking about for three years. It's completely understandable to feel this way, especially when you feel like you let an opportunity slip away. It's important to remember that it's okay to feel these emotions and to take the time to process them. It might be helpful to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling, or to write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal. It's also important to be kind to yourself and to practice self-care during this time. Remember that it's okay to take things one day at a time, and to focus on your own well-being. Sending you lots of support and understanding.
"," I'm really sorry to hear that you're still struggling with thoughts of a past relationship that didn't work out. It's natural to feel this way, especially when we care deeply for someone. It's important to remember that dwelling on the past can prevent us from fully engaging in the present. While it's understandable that you hope for another chance, focusing too much on what could have been may hinder your personal growth and happiness. Try to focus on the things you can control in your life right now, and consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you move forward. Remember, every experience, even the difficult ones, can teach us valuable lessons.","Hey, it sounds like you're hung up on someone from your past. That's tough, but you know, sometimes things just don't work out. It's important to try and move on, though. Maybe you'll get another shot, maybe not. Either way, you can't change the past, so you might as well focus on the future. Try to keep yourself busy with other things and eventually, you'll probably stop thinking about them so much.","I can hear the depth of your feelings in your words, and it's clear that this person has had a profound impact on your life. It must be incredibly difficult to grapple with the thought that you were so close to a relationship with someone you've longed for over the years, especially when you feel responsible for the missed opportunity. The hope for another chance speaks volumes about your desire to connect with them, and it's understandable that you're holding onto that possibility. It's okay to reflect on what might have been, but I also sense your determination to learn from this experience. Remember, self-forgiveness is a crucial step in healing and moving forward, whether it leads back to them or towards new beginnings."
9,relationship,185,"How do you calm the worries? I'm just now encountering my first serious relationship. I'm sure so many people can relate to the anxiety that comes with being in a legitimate relationship for the first time. I try to be confident but sometimes the anxiety gets the best of me and I start having fear over things like: Will he eventually fall out of love with me? Will he look at me one day and decide he doesn't want me or love me? Will it be something that gradually happens?- cheating. I have heard so many stories and I am terrified. That would absolutely break me. I am terrified of someone else catching his interest & it happening. I know one of his coworkers is really toxic and they had history; I have an irrational fear that she'll try things again once she knows we're serious. I'm just so terrified it holds me back. I've been so confident but as of recent, I just have this fear in my mind of these two things happening. How do you quell your worries about these things? :(","I can see you’re super worried and anxious and you know what, that’s a normal feeling to have when you’re in an invested relationship. In order to calm these worries, communication is key. Talk about your feelings with your partner, and make sure you talk about it in a healthy way (try not to overinvest or incorrectly direct your negative emotions towards them). I’m super neurotic so when it comes to those types of things, I always try to communicate and be as transparent as possible. Talking it out takes out the mental thought rumination that happens in your head. This might not completely quell your worries, but it will likely give you a break. As well, I suggest practicing self-generation of happiness. Being independent and enjoying things beyond your relationship is also very helpful.","It's completely natural to feel anxious when navigating the uncharted waters of a first serious relationship. The fears you're experiencing are shared by many, and it's okay to acknowledge them. Remember, anxiety often stems from our desire to control the uncontrollable봪ike someone else's feelings or actions. It's important to focus on what you can control: your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
 
 To calm your worries, try to engage in open and honest communication with your partner. Expressing your feelings can help build trust and understanding between you both. Also, consider practicing self-care and mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or journaling, to manage anxiety.
 
 Building self-confidence is key. Remind yourself of your worth and the unique qualities you bring to the relationship. Trust is fundamental, and while it's challenging, try to trust in your partner's commitment to you.
 
 Lastly, if the anxiety becomes overwhelming, don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or a professional counselor who can provide you with tools and strategies to cope with these fears. Remember, you're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help.","Hey there! 🤗 I totally understand how you feel - it's completely normal to have these fears and anxieties in a new relationship, especially when it's your first serious one. It's natural to feel vulnerable and unsure, but remember that these feelings are temporary and can be managed with time and effort. Firstly, let's address the fear of your partner falling out of love with you. It's important to remember that love is a choice, and it's not something that can be lost overnight. If your partner has chosen to be with you, it's likely that they value and care for you deeply. It's okay to have moments of doubt, but try not to let those doubts consume you. Instead, focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that bring you joy and happiness together. Regarding the fear of cheating, it's important to remember that you can't control your partner's actions or thoughts. However, you can control how you react to situations and how you communicate your feelings to your partner. It's important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your fears and boundaries. Talk to them about what makes you feel uncomfortable or anxious, and work together to find solutions that make you both feel safe and secure. Lastly, it's understandable that you have an irrational fear of your partner's coworker, but try not to let that fear consume you. It's important to remember that your partner has chosen to be with you, and it's unlikely that they would risk their relationship with you for someone else. Instead of focusing on the negative, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that bring you joy and happiness together. Remember that it's okay to feel scared and anxious in a new relationship, but it's important to not let those feelings hold you back. Take things one step at a time, communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and focus on the positive aspects of your relationship. With time and effort, you can work through these fears and build a strong and healthy relationship. 💕"," I'm here to listen and offer support. It's normal to have fears and anxieties in a new relationship, especially around the possibility of losing the other person's love or trust. These thoughts can be overwhelming, but remember that every relationship is unique and your partner chose you for a reason. Communication is key. Talking openly about your fears and concerns with your partner can help build trust and strengthen your bond. It's also important to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that make you feel loved and appreciated. Try practicing self-care and mindfulness techniques to help manage your anxiety and remind yourself of your worth. Remember, it's impossible to predict the future, but you can control how you react to potential challenges. Trust in yourself and your partner, and know that you're not alone in feeling these fears.","Just relax and stop worrying so much. Everyone gets nervous in a new relationship, but you can't let that control you. If he's going to cheat or leave, there's nothing you can do about it. Just enjoy the relationship while it lasts and don't stress over things you can't control. If you keep thinking about these things, you're going to ruin the relationship with your insecurities. Just be confident and everything will work out fine.","I hear the depth of your anxiety and it's completely natural to feel this way when stepping into new, meaningful territory. The fear of loss and betrayal can be overwhelming, especially when you've heard stories that fuel these fears. It's clear that you value this relationship deeply and the thought of it being threatened, particularly by someone with a past connection to your partner, is distressing. To manage these worries, communication with your partner is key. Expressing your feelings openly can build trust and understanding. Also, consider exploring the root of these fears, perhaps with a counselor, to strengthen your emotional resilience. Remember, it's okay to feel vulnerable; it's a sign of the genuine care and investment you have in this relationship. Take each day as it comes, and try to focus on the positives you both bring to each other's lives."

11,relationship,239,"I love my girl so much. Yesterday, I was helping an old man in our apartment complex while my Girlfriend was housesitting for a friend on the other side of town. As I was entering the complex with him carrying the furniture he needed assistance with. My back seized up, and I almost fell down with the furniture. It hurt to move. Even Hurt to breath. It was an intense pain all through my back. I powered through, made it up into our apartment and found the bed. She called me and asked what happened because she's seen me on the video doorbell and I looked like I was in pain, I explained and she quickly rushed 20 minutes back out to our apartment. She got me a heating pad, fed me pain medicine, massaged my back, even helped me get to the bathroom, and got me food and drink when I needed it. She stayed with me almost the whole evening, (she had to go back to where she was housesitting)I CRIED. So much. I felt so weak and powerless and she cared for me so easily, so naturally. She made sure I was okay, and even with my pained range of motion could easily grab the tv remote or whatever so I wouldn't be bored or thirsty/hungry. She's an absolute goddess. And I needed to share that. Thankfully, the pain subsided and I'm feeling totally fine today!","Wow, your feelings about your girlfriend are clear as day, I can totally see passionate gratitude coming off you right now.

12,parenting,138,"One of my kids is in the first grade.  They started school at the beginning of August.  The teacher sits at her desk basically all day while the kids do worksheets that are overly simplistic even for their young age.  Friday, she sent home progress reports.  The scores just didn't really fit my son's strengths and weaknesses.  A friend that also has a child in the class and I compared notes and the scores for both children were exactly the same-all 19 of them.  So, I'm guessing she just filled this evaluation the same for each student.  What do you think I should do about it?  I don't want to alienate her considering she is my kid's teacher, but this doesn't seem right.  I'm new at this school thing (as a parent) and would love your opinions.  Thanks.","You’ve got to address your problem directly to the teacher first. Have you ever addressed a concern to the teacher directly? If I were you, I would ask to schedule a meeting with the teacher and talk about your child’s performance to see whenever or not they can justify the home progress reports. How does your child feel about the teacher? Does he feel like he is learning anything new or simulating? If what your saying is true (i.e. solving simple worksheets), then this is a serious issue that requires immediate attention. Education is really important at a young age and shapes how people will learn forever. First, schedule a meeting and then talk with your child privately about how they feel in school academically. And then we can move forward afterward. ","It's completely understandable that you're concerned about your child's education and the approach the teacher is taking. It's important for progress reports to accurately reflect each child's individual abilities and progress, and it's concerning that your son's report doesn't seem to align with his strengths and weaknesses. It's also quite disconcerting that the reports for two different children are identical.
 
 Before taking any action, it might be helpful to gather more information. Consider requesting a meeting with the teacher to discuss your son's progress report. Approach the conversation with curiosity rather than accusation, which can help maintain a positive relationship. You could express your appreciation for her work and then share your observations, asking for clarification on how the evaluations are determined.
 
 If after the meeting you still have concerns, it might be appropriate to reach out to the school's administration for further guidance. Remember, advocating for your child's education is important, and doing so respectfully can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.","Hi there! I can completely understand your concerns about your son's progress report. It sounds like the teacher may have been a bit too hasty or uniform in her evaluations, and it's understandable that you want to ensure your child is being assessed accurately. Firstly, I would suggest speaking with the teacher directly and sharing your concerns in a respectful and open-minded way. You might say something like, ""I noticed that my son's progress report looked very similar to his friend's, and I'm wondering if there might have been any consistency issues in the evaluation. Could we discuss this further and ensure that my son is being assessed accurately?"" It's important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, rather than accusation or blame. Remember, the teacher is there to support your child's learning, and they may have a different perspective or insight that can help you better understand the situation. Additionally, you might consider speaking with the school's administration or a guidance counselor to get their input and advice on how to proceed. They may be able to offer additional support or resources to help your child succeed. Remember, it's okay to advocate for your child and ensure they are receiving the education they deserve. However, it's important to do so in a respectful and constructive manner that benefits everyone involved. Good luck!
"," I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling concerned about your child's progress reports. It's understandable that you want to ensure your child is getting the individualized attention they need. Based on your observation and comparison with another parent, it seems there might be an issue with the consistency and accuracy of the evaluations. You could consider scheduling a meeting with the teacher to discuss your concerns and ask for more detailed information about your child's progress. Express your desire to work collaboratively to support your child's learning. Remember, open communication is key to building a strong partnership between home and school.","Hey there, it sounds like you're not happy with your child's teacher. If you think the progress reports are not accurate, maybe you should talk to the teacher or someone at the school about it. It's important to make sure your child is getting a good education, so don't be afraid to speak up if something seems off. Good luck!","I can only imagine how disheartening it must feel to see your child's first educational experiences not being taken with the individual care and attention you had hoped for. It's concerning to hear that the progress reports seem generic and not reflective of your son's unique abilities and challenges. It's completely valid to feel hesitant about approaching the teacher, as you're navigating the delicate balance between advocating for your child and maintaining a positive relationship with the educator responsible for their daily learning. I would encourage you to trust your instincts as a parent. Perhaps you could request a meeting with the teacher to discuss your son's progress in a constructive manner, expressing your observations without accusation. It's important to open a dialogue that focuses on your child's needs and how you can work together to support their educational journey. Remember, you are your child's first and most important advocate, and it's okay to seek clarity and partnership in their education."
13,parenting,90,"Hi There, My gf is french speaking, and I am english speaking.. we both are able to communicate in both languages... but obviously we have our preferred languages, and are better in one more than the other.. We anticipate that our little monster (read, """"Bundle of love and joy) is going to be bilingual one day, however, I am curious if there is anyone out there who has raised a child in a similar environment (mixed language household) that has encountered any struggles, or any welcome surprises along the way. ","Hey! While I haven’t been in your type of situation I can say that I highly urge you to keep on communicating in both languages with your child. While I was being raised my family was only allowed to speak English since my sibling was somewhat on the autistic spectrum and the ESL teachers urged my mother to not speak Vietnamese to them. In effect, I feel like I lost an opportunity to communicate with my culture. So keep on doing you, and I hope everything goes well for y'all! I think the most important aspect is remembering to be consistent and patient. Celebrate the small victories when teaching them and celebrate the little things when they achieve something great. I bet everything will turn out all right. ","Hello!
 
 It's wonderful to hear that you're embracing the journey of raising a bilingual child. Being exposed to multiple languages from an early age can be a fantastic opportunity for your little one. While I haven't personally raised a child in a bilingual household, I've seen many families successfully navigate this path. 
 
 Some common challenges include moments of language mixing or preference for one language over the other, which is entirely normal. Children may also go through phases where they speak one language more, but with time and consistent exposure, they tend to balance out.
 
 On the flip side, there are many delightful surprises! Bilingual children often develop a keen awareness of different cultures, display cognitive flexibility, and have the ability to communicate with a wider range of people.
 
 Remember, patience and consistency are key. Encourage communication in both languages without pressure, and celebrate the small victories along the way. Your ""bundle of love and joy"" is on the path to becoming a wonderful communicator in both English and French!
 
 Best wishes on your bilingual adventure!","Hello there! I completely understand your situation, as I am also part of a mixed language household. My partner and I speak different languages at home, and we have experienced both challenges and joys in raising our children to be bilingual. One welcome surprise for us was seeing our children effortlessly switch between languages and adapt to both cultures. However, we have also faced some struggles, such as finding resources and support in both languages, and navigating social situations where not everyone speaks the same language. I would love to hear more about your experience and offer any support or advice that I can. Have you considered seeking out bilingual support groups or resources in your area? These can be a great source of information and connection for families like yours. Additionally, there are many online resources and forums for bilingual families that you may find helpful. Please feel free to share more about your journey, and I'll do my best to offer support and understanding.
"," Hello, I understand your situation. Raising a child in a bilingual household can be a wonderful experience, but it also comes with its challenges. Many families in similar situations have reported that their children develop strong language skills in both languages. However, some struggles may include code-switching, language dominance, and potential confusion in the early stages. It's essential to be patient and consistent in using both languages. Embrace the journey and enjoy the unique experience of watching your child grow bilingual. Remember, every child is different, and there may be unexpected surprises along the way. Good luck!","Hey, raising a bilingual kid sounds cool and trendy. I guess it could be a bit confusing for the child at first, but they'll probably pick up both languages quickly. Kids are like sponges with that stuff. Just make sure you both keep speaking your languages at home and the little one will catch on. It's a good skill to have, being bilingual, so it's definitely worth the effort.","Hello there, I can sense the excitement and a touch of concern in your words as you think about the future of your child growing up in a bilingual household. It's a beautiful journey you're embarking on, and it's natural to wonder about the unique experiences that lie ahead. While I haven't personally raised a child in a mixed-language environment, I understand that it can come with its own set of challenges and joys. From what I've heard, children in bilingual homes may initially mix languages or experience slight delays in language proficiency, but they often become adept at switching between languages seamlessly as they grow. It's also a wonderful opportunity for your child to deeply connect with both cultures and develop cognitive advantages. I'm here to listen and support you through any concerns or questions you might have, and I'd be happy to help you find resources or connect with parents who've had similar experiences."
14,parenting,137,"I realize that the two aren't mutually exclusive. I have a lot of good friends and family who are Christian, and a few friends who are gay. I don't really have anything against either group. It's just that I'd find it much easier being supportive of a gay son than a Christian son. I'm straight, but I can understand being in love, and I think I could deal with the first time my son brings home a boyfriend if he turns out to be gay. As an atheist, though, I can't understand believing in God, and I think if he turns out to be Christian, it would be hard for me to be supportive. He'd have more community support as a Christian, but I feel like it would be harder to connect with him myself.
Is this selfish?","I think you are asking the wrong question on whether or not you think it is selfish to think the way you are thinking. In my opinion, the capacity to connect with others doesn’t require you to completely understand their beliefs or preferences. When you connect with someone, you see beyond all of those biases and connect through similarities and differences. Supporting a family doesn’t require us to understand them. I think family should be shrouded in unconditional love, especially if those conditions don’t necessarily harm another. Therefore, to answer your question, I do think it is selfish to consider yourself not supportive of your hypothetical son’s religious beliefs. Regardless of what they believe in, you should support the things that make someone else happy unless those things are things that harm themself or others. However, maybe your definition of supportive is different from mine. ","It's commendable that you're reflecting on your feelings and considering how they might affect your relationship with your son. It's not uncommon to feel more at ease with experiences that we can personally relate to. Your honesty about your struggle to understand a belief in God is a sign of self-awareness, not selfishness. However, it's important to recognize that support isn't always about understanding, but about accepting and loving someone for who they are, including their beliefs.
 
 It might be helpful to consider that support can take many forms. Listening, showing interest, and being open to learning about his perspective can be powerful ways to show support, even if you don't share the same beliefs. Remember, the core of support is love and acceptance. Your son's journey, whether it involves his sexuality or his faith, will be unique to him, and your role as a parent is to accompany him with an open heart and mind. It's okay to have these feelings, and seeking to bridge the gap already shows your willingness to be supportive.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings with me. It's understandable that you would want to be supportive of your child, regardless of their sexual orientation or religious beliefs. However, it's important to recognize that being supportive doesn't mean you have to fully understand or agree with their beliefs or lifestyle. What's important is that you are there for your child, listen to their needs, and offer them love and acceptance. It's also important to recognize that being an atheist doesn't mean you can't understand or respect someone else's beliefs. Many atheists are able to understand and appreciate the beliefs of others, even if they don't personally share those beliefs. It's not selfish to prioritize your own beliefs and values, but it's important to consider how your beliefs may impact your relationship with your child. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your child about your beliefs and values, and to listen to their perspective as well. This can help you both better understand each other and find common ground, even if you don't agree on everything.
"," It's understandable that you may feel more comfortable supporting certain aspects of your child's identity based on your own experiences and beliefs. However, it's important to remember that unconditional love and support should be a priority, regardless of your personal beliefs or understanding. It's natural to have different levels of comfort with various aspects of your child's identity, but it's crucial to make every effort to be there for them and accept them fully. You may not be able to fully understand or relate to your child's religious beliefs as an atheist, but that doesn't mean you can't be supportive and loving. It's essential to focus on building a strong and open relationship with your child, allowing them to express themselves freely and feel accepted and loved for who they are.","I see you're having a hard time with the idea of your son being Christian. You're an atheist, so naturally, you'd find it easier to relate to a gay son than a Christian one. It's just about what you're comfortable with, right? You shouldn't worry too much about it. Most people find it easier to connect with others who share their beliefs. It's not selfish to feel more at ease with something you understand better. Your son will have plenty of support from the community if he's Christian, so you don't need to stress about it.","I hear you expressing a deep sense of introspection and concern about your potential to support your son in all aspects of his identity. It's clear that you value love and understanding, and you're trying to reconcile these values with your personal beliefs. Your honesty in acknowledging the difficulty you might face in supporting a Christian son, as an atheist, shows a willingness to confront your own biases and limitations. It's not selfish to recognize where you might struggle; it's a sign of your commitment to being the best parent you can be. You're considering not just your own feelings, but the broader support your son would receive, and how your relationship with him might be affected. This reflection is a crucial step towards finding ways to bridge the gap between your worldviews, should this situation arise, and it speaks to your deep love for your son."

All of his toys, regardless of their intended use are now ""fighting"", basically he just bashes them together for the entire duration of his playtime. Train tracks fight Buzz Lightyear, Thomas the tank engine and a Lego duke it out, it's a little exhausting. We aren't even sure where he picked this up. Does it ever end? We aren't too concerned, mostly curious and wondering if this behavior is a phase or if the rest of parents listen to crashing plastic all day for years at a time.","I have no clue whether it ends or not, but as in most things in life, things will always change and end. The only concern I have as of right now for you guys is whether or not it goes to a different dangerous degree (i.e. playing with fire or hurting small animals). I would just keep an eye on the kid’s behavior and maybe perhaps guide them away from play-fighting into different areas of fun. Hopefully it is just a phase that goes away once their interest grows out of “play-fighting.” The fact that you reached out though speaks volumes and shows that yall do care, and I am happy for that. One piece of advice that I can offer is the greate gentle boundaries regarding playflighting. Maybe create specific times and areas for play fighting, so that it isn’t a constant thing going on.

It's quite common for children, especially around the age of three, to engage in this type of play.

While it can be exhausting to listen to, it's completely normal for young children to engage in this type of play, especially at the age of three. Children this age are still learning about boundaries and developing their social skills, so it's possible that your child may have picked up this behavior from observing others or through their own imagination. It's good to hear that you're not too concerned about it, and it's understandable to be curious about whether or not it's a phase. While it's impossible to predict with certainty, it's likely that this behavior will phase out as your child's cognitive and social development continues. In the meantime, you might consider providing your child with a variety of toys that encourage different types of play, such as building blocks, puzzles, or dress-up clothes. This can help to diversify their play and potentially reduce the focus on play-fighting. Remember, it's completely normal for young children to engage in behaviors that may be exhausting or frustrating for parents, and it's important to be patient and understanding. With time and consistency, your child will continue to develop and grow, and their play habits will likely evolve along with them.
"," I understand that it can be tiring and concerning to see your toddler engaging in play-fighting with all of his toys. It's a common developmental stage for children around this age as they explore different ways to express themselves and learn about cause and effect. This behavior is often a sign of active imagination and creativity. While it may seem exhausting, it's important to remember that this phase usually passes as they grow older and develop more complex play patterns.

But overall, it's a normal part of childhood development.","It's pretty normal for kids to go through various play phases, and they often like to play-fight with their toys. It's just a way for them to explore and use their imagination. He'll probably grow out of it eventually. In the meantime, maybe try introducing some new activities or toys that encourage different types of play. It's just something kids do, so there's not much to worry about.","I can imagine that the constant sound of toys clashing can be quite overwhelming for you as a parent. It's interesting how children can be so creative in their play, even if it means turning every toy into a character in a battle scene. It's understandable to be curious about where he picked up this behavior, especially if it's not something that's actively encouraged at home. While it's true that many children go through phases where certain types of play are more appealing, it's also a way for them to process their world and feelings. This phase might be his way of exploring concepts like conflict and resolution, power, and control. Rest assured, many parents do experience similar stages with their children, and often these phases do pass as the child's interests and cognitive abilities develop. In the meantime, you might consider setting aside specific times for quiet play or introducing new activities that can engage him in different ways, which might provide you with some respite from the 'crashing plastic' symphony."
