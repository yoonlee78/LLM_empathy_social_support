 It might be helpful to consider confirming the interview a day in advance and perhaps even an hour before the scheduled time. This could help to ensure that the candidate remembers and prioritizes the interview. Additionally, you might want to ask for confirmation of their attendance as part of your scheduling process.

It's natural to feel vulnerable and unsure, but remember that these feelings are temporary and can be managed with time and effort. Firstly, let's address the fear of your partner falling out of love with you. It's important to remember that love is a choice, and it's not something that can be lost overnight. If your partner has chosen to be with you, it's likely that they value and care for you deeply. It's okay to have moments of doubt, but try not to let those doubts consume you. Instead, focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that bring you joy and happiness together. Regarding the fear of cheating, it's important to remember that you can't control your partner's actions or thoughts. However, you can control how you react to situations and how you communicate your feelings to your partner. It's important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your fears and boundaries. Talk to them about what makes you feel uncomfortable or anxious, and work together to find solutions that make you both feel safe and secure. Lastly, it's understandable that you have an irrational fear of your partner's coworker, but try not to let that fear consume you. It's important to remember that your partner has chosen to be with you, and it's unlikely that they would risk their relationship with you for someone else. Instead of focusing on the negative, try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the things that bring you joy and happiness together. Remember that it's okay to feel scared and anxious in a new relationship, but it's important to not let those feelings hold you back. Take things one step at a time, communicate openly and honestly with your partner, and focus on the positive aspects of your relationship. With time and effort, you can work through these fears and build a strong and healthy relationship. 💕",1,352,17.87,98.8,20.79,36.46,18.53,24.15,95.74,76.42,59.38,21.88,11.08,0.28,0.28,9.38,0,1.14,10.8,14.77,3.98,1.14,13.64,9.38,4.83,8.81,1.42,17.9,9.38,1.42,9.66,5.97,1.99,1.7,18.47,0,18.18,6.25,2.27,2.56,2.56,0.85,4.55,1.42,9.66,5.4,4.26,5.11,1.7,3.41,3.13,0,0,0,19.89,6.53,3.13,0.28,0.28,0.57,1.42,13.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.7,0,0,1.7,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0.85,0,8.52,6.53,1.14,1.14,1.99,0,0,2.27,1.99,1.99,8.52,0,0.85,0.28,0.57,0,0,15.63,4.83,5.11,0,0.28,5.11,0.28,0.57

Being independent and enjoying things beyond your relationship is also very helpful.",gpt_high,"I hear the depth of your anxiety and it's completely natural to feel this way when stepping into new, meaningful territory. The fear of loss and betrayal can be overwhelming, especially when you've heard stories that fuel these fears. It's clear that you value this relationship deeply and the thought of it being threatened, particularly by someone with a past connection to your partner, is distressing. To manage these worries, communication with your partner is key. Expressing your feelings openly can build trust and understanding. Also, consider exploring the root of these fears, perhaps with a counselor, to strengthen your emotional resilience. Remember, it's okay to feel vulnerable; it's a sign of the genuine care and investment you have in this relationship.

As I was entering the complex with him carrying the furniture he needed assistance with. My back seized up, and I almost fell down with the furniture. It hurt to move. Even Hurt to breath. It was an intense pain all through my back. I powered through, made it up into our apartment and found the bed. She called me and asked what happened because she's seen me on the video doorbell and I looked like I was in pain, I explained and she quickly rushed 20 minutes back out to our apartment. She got me a heating pad, fed me pain medicine, massaged my back, even helped me get to the bathroom, and got me food and drink when I needed it. She stayed with me almost the whole evening, (she had to go back to where she was housesitting)I CRIED. So much. I felt so weak and powerless and she cared for me so easily, so naturally. She made sure I was okay, and even with my pained range of motion could easily grab the tv remote or whatever so I wouldn't be bored or thirsty/hungry. She's an absolute goddess. And I needed to share that. Thankfully, the pain subsided and I'm feeling totally fine today!","Wow, your feelings about your girlfriend are clear as day, I can totally see passionate gratitude coming off you right now.

 Before taking any action, it might be helpful to gather more information. Consider requesting a meeting with the teacher to discuss your son's progress report. Approach the conversation with curiosity rather than accusation, which can help maintain a positive relationship. You could express your appreciation for her work and then share your observations, asking for clarification on how the evaluations are determined.

Could we discuss this further and ensure that my son is being assessed accurately?"" It's important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, rather than accusation or blame. Remember, the teacher is there to support your child's learning, and they may have a different perspective or insight that can help you better understand the situation. Additionally, you might consider speaking with the school's administration or a guidance counselor to get their input and advice on how to proceed. They may be able to offer additional support or resources to help your child succeed. Remember, it's okay to advocate for your child and ensure they are receiving the education they deserve.

 It's wonderful to hear that you're embracing the journey of raising a bilingual child. Being exposed to multiple languages from an early age can be a fantastic opportunity for your little one. While I haven't personally raised a child in a bilingual household, I've seen many families successfully navigate this path. 
 
 Some common challenges include moments of language mixing or preference for one language over the other, which is entirely normal. Children may also go through phases where they speak one language more, but with time and consistent exposure, they tend to balance out.
 
 On the flip side, there are many delightful surprises! Bilingual children often develop a keen awareness of different cultures, display cognitive flexibility, and have the ability to communicate with a wider range of people.
 
 Remember, patience and consistency are key. Encourage communication in both languages without pressure, and celebrate the small victories along the way. Your ""bundle of love and joy"" is on the path to becoming a wonderful communicator in both English and French!

While I was being raised my family was only allowed to speak English since my sibling was somewhat on the autistic spectrum and the ESL teachers urged my mother to not speak Vietnamese to them. In effect, I feel like I lost an opportunity to communicate with my culture. So keep on doing you, and I hope everything goes well for y'all!",gpt_high,"Hello there, I can sense the excitement and a touch of concern in your words as you think about the future of your child growing up in a bilingual household. It's a beautiful journey you're embarking on, and it's natural to wonder about the unique experiences that lie ahead. While I haven't personally raised a child in a mixed-language environment, I understand that it can come with its own set of challenges and joys. From what I've heard, children in bilingual homes may initially mix languages or experience slight delays in language proficiency, but they often become adept at switching between languages seamlessly as they grow. It's also a wonderful opportunity for your child to deeply connect with both cultures and develop cognitive advantages. I'm here to listen and support you through any concerns or questions you might have, and I'd be happy to help you find resources or connect with parents who've had similar experiences.",1,156,51.62,76.24,91.37,97.2,26,26.92,86.54,66.67,55.13,15.38,10.26,3.85,0,5.13,0,1.28,5.13,10.9,5.77,0,17.31,9.62,4.49,8.97,0.64,16.67,4.49,1.28,4.49,1.28,2.56,1.28,13.46,0,13.46,3.85,0,1.92,5.77,0,4.49,0,6.41,6.41,0,1.92,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,17.31,5.13,1.28,0.64,0,0,1.28,10.26,1.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.92,0,1.28,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,0.64,5.77,14.1,0.64,1.28,10.26,0,1.28,1.28,3.85,1.92,4.49,2.56,0,0,0,0,0,14.1,3.85,3.85,0,0,5.77,0.64,0
