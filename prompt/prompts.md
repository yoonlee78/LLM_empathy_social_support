Example Output:

Very Low Level of Empathic Understanding:
"Hey, I read your message. It sounds like you made a mistake with the invoice. Next time, try to double-check your work to avoid these issues. It’s important to keep track of which client and which company you are dealing with to prevent this kind of problem. Remember, it’s your responsibility to ensure all details are correct before sending out any documents."

Very High Level of Empathic Understanding:
"I'm really sorry to hear about the mix-up with the invoice and the tough situation it put you in. It sounds incredibly frustrating, especially since you weren't given the necessary information beforehand. The fact that you apologized despite the lack of communication shows your professionalism and commitment. It's not easy to take responsibility, especially when the mistake arises from a systemic issue rather than a personal oversight. I hope your boss can see the confusion from your perspective and appreciate your willingness to rectify the situation, even when it wasn't your fault. Remember, your effort and integrity still stand strong, despite the mix-up."
